let pitchTips:[String:String] = [
    "monotone" : "A monotone delivery can quickly lull your audience to sleep. The ideal pitch ranges from 180 to 250 Hertz. To keep your presentation engaging, make sure to modulate your pitch throughout your talk. Raise your pitch slightly when emphasizing key points and lower it when explaining details. This simple variation in pitch will add emphasis to your message and help keep your audience engaged.",
    "tooHigh" : "A squeaky-high pitch can be grating to your audience and make you sound nervous or lacking in confidence. The ideal pitch ranges from 180 to 250 Hertz. To gain control over your pitch, employ diaphragmatic breathing techniques into your practice. Take deep breaths and exhale slowly while speaking. This will help you project a deeper, more resonant voice.",
    "tooLow" : "A voice that's too low can make your audience struggle to hear you and come across as lazy or unenthusiastic. The ideal pitch ranges from 180 to 250 Hertz. To project your voice without raising your pitch, practice projecting your voice to the back of the room. This will help you increase your pitch without straining your vocal cords or raising your pitch unnaturally."

let pitchTricks:[String:String] = [
    "monotone" : "Practice reading your script aloud using different pitches. Listen back to your recordings to get a sense of how pitch variation can make your presentation more dynamic. This self-assessment will help you identify areas where you can improve your pitch modulation and deliver a more engaging presentation.",
    "tooHigh" : "Pay attention to situations that tend to trigger your high-pitched voice, such as nervousness or anxiety. When you find yourself in these situations, practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness exercises to calm your nerves and lower your pitch naturally.",
    "tooLow" : "Incorporate vocal exercises into your routine to find a lower pitch that's still comfortable and clear. Humming, scales, and tongue twisters can help you warm up your vocal cords and expand your vocal range, allowing you to project a clear and engaging voice without resorting to a strained high pitch."

let paceTips:[String:String] = [
    "tooFast" : "A rapid-fire or rap-like delivery can leave your audience lost and overwhelmed, causing them to miss critical information. The ideal pace ranges from 120 to 150 words per minute. To slow down your pace, employ deep breathing techniques. Take deep breaths and exhale slowly as you speak. This controlled breathing will help you calm your nerves and find a more natural, measured pace.",
    "noPause" : " ",
    "tooSlow" : "A lethargic pace can quickly bore your audience and leave them feeling disengaged. The ideal pace ranges from 120 to 150 words per minute. To combat this, inject energy and enthusiasm into your presentation. Vary your vocal tone, use expressive gestures, and move around the stage to keep your audience captivated."

    "tooFast" : "Strategic pauses can be your allies in combating a rushed pace. Incorporate pauses after key points to allow your audience time to absorb the information and reflect on its significance. These pauses will also give you a moment to gather your thoughts and maintain a composed demeanor.",
    "noPause" : " ",
    "tooSlow" : "Weave storytelling techniques into your presentation. Share anecdotes, personal experiences, and relatable stories to illustrate your points and connect with your audience on an emotional level. This engaging approach will keep your audience hooked and prevent them from losing interest due to a slow pace."

    "tooLoud" : "Be aware of your natural volume. The ideal volume ranges from 60 to 80 decibels. Try standing near a wall and talk at a comfortable level. If you hear yourself echo significantly, you're likely too loud. When presenting, focus on projecting your voice from your diaphragm instead of staining your throat.",

    "tooLoud" : "Think of your presentation as a conversation with a small group instead of a mass audience. Move closer or farther from the microphone or audience for emphasis, rather than relying solely on volume. Regularly practice presentations at a lower volume to train your vocal muscles and build confidence.",

let pauseTips:[String:String] = [
    "tooMuch" : "Listen back to the recording and analyse the reason: are you searching for words, unsure of the next point, or simply taking breath? A well-structures presentation with clear transitions between points minimizes the need for long pauses to fill gaps.",

    "tooMuch" : "Use brief pause to emphasize key points transition between ideas, or capture attention. Medium pauses allowing audience to process complex information, reflect on questions, or anticipate a change in direction. Reserve longer pauses for moments of high emotional impact, dramatic reveals, or allowing the audience to fully absorb a crucial meaning. Utilize eye contact, facial expressions, and gestures to maintain audience engagements during pauses.",
